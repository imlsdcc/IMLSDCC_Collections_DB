This repository contains the models for the IMLS Digital Collections & Content Collections Registry and Item Repository databases. It also contains many of the standard SQL queries that mine essential data from the collections registry database. Data was entered into the collections registry by hand or through an .asp web form (not included here). The collections registry database is designed to run in a MS SQL Server 2012 environment and the queries will need to be adjusted appropriately if implemented in other database environments.
